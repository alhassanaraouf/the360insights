4  Representative User Stories (new lines italic)

As an athlete, I want a “Rivals Radar” that lists my next five opponents with their top three vulnerabilities, so I can train purposefully this week.

As a head coach, I want an automated match plan that tells me where and when to press against Team X based on their passing network, so that we raise our win probability by at least 5 %.

As an opposition scout, I want a side-by-side spider chart of our winger and their full-back, plus AI-generated crossing tactics, so I can brief the coaching staff in under 10 minutes.

As a performance analyst, I want opponent style archetypes (high press, deep block, etc.) labeled automatically from event data, so scouting time drops 50 %.

Existing athlete-centric stories from the prior package still apply unchanged.

Time Saved: auto tactical report	Opposition analysts recoup ≈8 hrs / match.
Data Network Effects	More clubs onboard ⇒ richer opponent data graphs ⇒ better AI accuracy.

5.2  Revenue Model Tweaks
	•	“Match-Intel” Add-On: +30 % on any tier unlocks UC-06 & UC-07, including 500 opponent queries / month.
	•	Pay-as-you-go for extra opponent packs ($2 per query).

5.3  Key KPIs (added)
	•	Opponent Plan Adoption Rate (% of generated plans actually viewed by staff)
	•	Points-per-Match Delta when plan adopted vs. not (proof of ROI)

6  Acceptance Criteria — Opponent Features

AC-ID	Criterion
AC-OPP-01	Generating the Opponents List for a selected competition returns threat-ranked table with style tags (e.g., “High Press / Left-Bias”) in ≤7 s, P95.
AC-OPP-02	Clicking an opponent opens a dashboard showing top five strengths, weaknesses, last five results, and a win-probability heat map.
AC-OPP-03	“Win Plan” export includes session plan (drills, set-piece routines) and tactical comments; can be downloaded as PDF or pushed to Performs training calendar.
AC-OPP-04	Coach feedback loop: after a match, user can rate plan accuracy; model retrains weekly on feedback >40 ratings.
AC-OPP-05	RBAC ensures only users with “Coach” or higher can see full opponent tactical blueprints; scouts can view but not export raw data.

7  Roadmap Addendum
Quarter	New Milestone (Opponent Scope)
Q3-25	Integrate league fixtures API & initial opponent clustering model (k-means + event data).
Q4-25	Release Opponents List + basic Win Plan generator to beta clubs.
Q1-26	Add live in-match adaptive suggestions (edge deployment).
Q2-26	Expand to multi-sport opponent models (basketball, volleyball).

3  Representative User Stories (new)

As an athlete, I want to know my current world rank, the ranks of my next five opponents, and exactly how many points (and which events) I need to break into the top 50 within one season, so I can focus my efforts.

As a head coach, I want the system to simulate alternative season schedules and show which combination of events yields the highest expected rank jump with acceptable fatigue risk, so I can approve the optimal calendar.

As a sporting director, I need a projected “Rank Trajectory” curve for each scholarship candidate, so I can allocate funding to athletes with the greatest upside.

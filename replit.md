### Previous Changes (October 3, 2025)

- **Fixed Object Storage Bucket Initialization**: Resolved issue where profile pictures were uploaded to production bucket during dev imports

  - Fix: Changed initialization to `new Client({ bucketId })` to explicitly specify the target bucket
  - Added enhanced logging to show bucket ID during each upload operation
  - Removed unnecessary `init()` call and `isInitialized` checks since the client is now properly configured at instantiation
  - Dev imports now correctly use dev bucket: `replit-objstore-de6c58a6-b4f1-4ccd-8165-11037524c945`
  - Production uploads use prod bucket: `replit-objstore-63b87864-7da4-4fc4-94df-fe5bd8d4c39b`

### Previous Changes (October 2, 2025)

- **Environment-Based Object Storage Configuration**: Implemented dynamic bucket selection based on environment
  - Bucket selection: Uses `BUCKET_ID` env var if set, otherwise `NODE_ENV` determines bucket (production â†’ prod bucket, otherwise â†’ dev bucket)
  - Updated `server/bucket-storage.ts` to initialize client with environment-based bucket ID
  - Added console logging to show which bucket is being used on startup

### Data Flow
Authentication & athlete selection -> Data aggregation -> AI processing (OpenAI API) -> Real-time updates (WebSockets) -> Export & sharing (PDF).

### Key Architectural Decisions
1.  **Database Choice**: PostgreSQL for relational data integrity and complex analytics.
2.  **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o for accurate sports analysis.
3.  **Component Architecture**: Modular React components with TypeScript for maintainability.
4.  **State Management**: TanStack Query for efficient server state caching.
5.  **Styling Strategy**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui for consistent, customizable design.
6.  **Real-time Features**: WebSocket integration for live analysis.
7.  **Session Management**: Replit Key Value Store for zero-configuration session persistence.
8.  **Data Structure Refinement**: Consolidated ranking data into `athlete_ranks` and separated coaches into their own table for normalization. Removed external image URLs in favor of Replit Object Storage.

You are a World Taekwondo data specialist. I need you to provide authentic Egyptian Taekwondo athletes who are currently or recently ranked in official World Taekwondo rankings.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Only provide athletes who actually exist in World Taekwondo official records
- Include current world rankings (if ranked)
- Use authentic weight categories (e.g., -58kg, -68kg, -80kg, +87kg)
- Include real competition achievements with specific years
- Focus on active or recently active athletes (2020-2024)

Please provide 8-10 real Egyptian Taekwondo athletes in the following JSON format:

{
  "athletes": [
    {
      "name": "Real athlete name as in official records",
      "worldRank": number or null,
      "nationality": "EGY",
      "weight": "Official weight category",
      "gender": "Male or Female",
      "category": "Senior/Junior/Cadet",
      "achievements": ["Specific tournament results with years"],
      "currentStatus": "Active/Retired"
    }
  ]
}

CRITICAL: Only include athletes you can verify from authentic World Taekwondo sources. Do not create fictional athletes.

Examples of the format I need:
- "2023 African Championships Gold Medal"
- "2022 World Championships Bronze Medal"
- "2021 Olympic Games Participant"
- "World Ranking #15 (as of 2024)"
